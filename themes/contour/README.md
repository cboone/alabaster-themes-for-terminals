# Alabaster Themes for Contour

## Installation

Add the color scheme to your `~/.config/contour/contour.yml` under the `color_schemes:` section.

You can either:

1. Copy the entire contents of the theme file into your config
2. Or copy just the scheme definition (everything after the comment header)

Then reference the scheme in your profile:

```yaml
profiles:
  main:
    colors: alabaster_dark
```
